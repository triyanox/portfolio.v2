An application programming interface or API, is a technology to share information
between computers or between computer programs, REST or Representational state transfer
is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints make the behavior
of your API predictable.

To build your first API first you need to understand how a REST API works, a restful API
resources into a banche of unique URIs **Uniform Resource Identifier** to differentiate various
data resources on the server.

A client can get data from a resource by sending an HTTP request, this request contains
the following elements:

1. A request line that contains 3 elements:
   - a method or an **HTTP** verb to tells the server what the client is trying to do, this method can be
     **GET** to get the data, **POST** to create new data, **PUT** to update the data and **DELETE** to delete
     the data .
   - a path to indicate where the resource is located .
   - HTTP version or the versions of the HTTP protocol used,remember the client and server might use different versions of the HTTP protocol,
     Both client and server must state the HTTP version of their request or response in the first line of their message.
2. A series of HTTP headers, or header fields, used to provide the recipient with information about the message.
3. A message body, if needed, and it contains the entity body, which can be in its original state,
   or can be encoded in some way for transport, such as by being broken into chunks (chunked transfer-coding).

This HTTP request will be something like this :

```:http
GET /static/index.html HTTP/1.1
Accept-Language: ar, en
If-Modified-Since: Wed, 16 Feb 2022 15:39:02 GMT
```

The server recives the request and executes some code and sends back an HTTP response
to the user, this response contains the following elements:

1. A status line, and it consists of three items:

   - HTTP version or the versions of the HTTP protocol used.
   - A status code contains 3 degits, indicates the result of the request. A status code in the
     200 level means Successful in 300 level
     means Redirection in 400 means Client error and in 500 means Server error .
   - A reason phrase or a status text to summarizes the meaning of the status code.

2. HTTP headers, contain informations that a client can use to find out more about the response.
3. A message body or response body, For a response to a successful request, the message body contains either the payload of data requested by the client,
   or some information about the status of the action requested by the client. And remember that if the client used the **HEAD**
   method the request body is not required .

This HTTP response may look like this :

```:http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2022 15:39:02 GMT
server: nginx/1.21.5
Content-type: image/jpg
```

Now you understand how REST APIs and HTTP work, let go to fun part and start making your
first API with **nodejs** and **expressjs**!

## What is Nodejs ?

When **Javascript** just got released the only way to execute **Javascript** code is inside a browser,
then **Nodejs** was created by Ryan Dahl and released in 2009. **Nodejs** is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript
runtime environment built on top of **Google's** **V8** engine and executes JavaScript code in the server.

With **Nodejs** we handle incoming HTTP requests by using the HTTP module to create a server and listen to events
on different routes like this :

```js:index.js
const http = require('http')
const fs = require('fs').promises
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/') {
    res.write('This is the Homepage')
    res.end()
  }
  if (req.url === '/api/users') {
    res.write(
      JSON.stringify([
        { id: 1, name: 'Mohamed Achaq' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Bojack Horseman' },
        { id: 3, name: 'Rick Sanchez' },
      ])
    )
    res.end()
  }
  if (req.url === '/index.html') {
    fs.readFile(__dirname + '/index.html').then((contents) => {
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html')
      res.writeHead(200)
      res.end(contents)
    })
  }
})
server.listen(5000)
console.log('listening on port 5000')
```

In this example we have required 2 modules the **http** module and the **fs** module which is the file system module
built in **Nodejs** core modules to read and serve an **HTML** file.

Then we have created an http server which takes callback function as an argument, and this callback function has two
parametres, the request and the response, then to handle each route we defined an if statement to handle the request and send
back a response to the client .

Then we called the listen method to listen on port **5000**

As you can see using the building blocks provided by **Nodejs** is not the efficient way to create a backend server,
because this is low level stuff but it's good to know this stuff, and to build real world application we use a framework
like **expresjs** which is the most popular !

## What is Express ?

**Express** is Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, provides a layer of abstraction on top of the
**http** module in **Nodejs**, and it's easy to learn and fun to use.

## Building your first API with express

### Creating an express project:

First check out if **Node** is installed in your machine by using this command

```bash:bash
node -v
```

Then to get started create a new folder, and start a terminal session in this folder .

Create a package.json file

```bash:bash
npm init
```

Install **expressjs** packgae

```bash:bash
npm i express
```

And create an index.js file where you code will execute

```bash:bash
touch index.js
```

and open it with your favourite code editor.

### Requiring the **Express** module:

In the top of your **index.js** file require the **express** module and store it in a constant called express then store
this constant in an other constant called **app**

```js:index.js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
```

### Create a listener

Like the **http** module we need a listener to listen to a giveen port

```js:index.js
app.listen(5000)
```

### Create some data:

In this article we're not going to use a real database to keep the article short and simple so we are going store our data
in memory keep in mind that in real world application we're not going to store data in memory we use databases.

```js:index.js
let users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Mohamed Achaq' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bojack Horseman' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Rick Sanchez' },
]
```

### Handling GET requests:

With **Express** handling **GET** request is very simple, we use the **app.get()** method that takes two arguments
the first argument is the route and the second is a callback function that takes a request and a response as arguments.

```js:index.js
// GET all the users
app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send(users)
})
```

### Handling GET requests by parametres:

When we want to get a specific element in our case to get single user by giveen id we use the id param in our **GET**
handler

```js:index.js
// GET user by id
app.get('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  let user = users.find((user) => user.id === parseInt(req.params.id))
  if (!user) {
    res.status(404).send('user not found')
    return
  }
  res.send(user)
})
```

in this example we have used the id param to get a user with matching id and if the user dosn't exist we return "user not found"
with status code of **404**

### Handling POST requests:

There is a rule when dealing with user input, **_Never trust user input_** , so in the next following request we will
use some form of validation and for this purpose there is a very famous open source package called **Joi**.

To get started with **Joi** open a terminal session in the root directory of your project and run this:

```bash:bash
npm i joi
```

and require it in your project

```js:index.js
const Joi = require('joi')
```

and create a reusable validation function, and in this function we define schema to validate the user with the validate
method

```js:index.js
// Validation Function
const validateUser = (user) => {
  const schema = Joi.object({
    name: Joi.string().min(3).required(),
  })
  return schema.validate(user)
}
```

now we can write our POST handler with input validation follow the [Joi Api Documentation](https://joi.dev/api/) to learn more .

```js:index.js
// POST requests
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  const { error } = validateUser(req.body)
  if (error) {
    res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message)
    return
  }
  const user = {
    id: users.length + 1,
    name: req.body.name,
  }
  users.push(user)
  res.send(user)
})
```

in this example we first validate the request body and if the user is valid we push it to the array also the id is assigned automatically
depending on how many users we have. And finally we send it back to the client.

### Handling PUT requests:

To handle the put request we're going to use the same validation function to validate the user input and the handeler will
be something like this:

```js:index.js
// PUT request
app.put('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Lookup the user
  let user = users.find((user) => user.id === parseInt(req.params.id))
  if (!user) {
    res.status(404).send('user not found')
    return
  }
  // validation
  const { error } = validateUser(req.body)
  if (error) {
    res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message)
    return
  }
  user.name = req.body.name
  res.send(user)
})
```

In this example first we lookup the user we want to update if dosn't exist we return "user not found " with a status code of **404**
and in case the user exist we validate the request body and we assign the name property from the request body to the name property in the user
object and we send it back to the client.

### Handling DELETE requests:

Finally to handle the **DELETE** request we will follow the same steps as the **POST** request and instad of pushing new object
we delete it like this

```js:index.js
app.delete('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Lookup the user
  let user = users.find((user) => user.id === parseInt(req.params.id))
  if (!user) {
    res.status(404).send('not found')
    return
  }
  //   Delete the user with the giveen id
  const userIndex = users.indexOf(user)
  users.splice(userIndex, 1)
  res.send(user)
})
```

## Testing the endpoints:

To test this endpoints you can use a **http client** like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) but I prefer to use
a tool called [Paw](https://paw.cloud/) I find it very intutive to work with but you can chose which one you prefer and read the documentation to learn how to use it.

## **Bonus** : Middleware

Middleware functions are function that take 3 arguments the request and the response objects and the next middleware function
and everytime the request-response cycle start the middleware function get executed in the request-response pipeline.
and to use middleware function in express we use the **app.use(yourMiddleware)**.

Express has some usefull built-in middleware function like this one

```js:index.js
app.use(express.json())
```

And it's used to parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on [body-parser](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/body-parser.html).

also you can make your own middleware functions, in the root directory of your project create a file called **customMiddleware.js**
and require it your **index.js** and use it .

```js:index.js
const customMiddleware = require('./customMiddleware')
```

```js:customMiddleware.js
app.use(customMiddleware)
```

inside this custom Middleware file add this function and export it

```js:customMiddleware.js
function myMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  console.log("processing...");
  next();
}
module.exports = myMiddleware;
```

basically this middleware will console log "processing..." everytime an request-response cycle starts.
