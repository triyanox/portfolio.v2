## Bit Shifting

Bit shifting is a the fastest way to multiply or divide a number by a power of 2 and used heavily in low level programming and cryptography.

For example we want to multiply the number `16` by 2, fisrt we need to convert the number `16` to binary which is `00010000` and then we need to shift the bits to the left by 1 which is `00100000` and then we need to convert the binary back to decimal which is `32`.

## Multiplication

To multiply a number by a power of 2, shift the bits to the left by the power of 2.

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x << 2; // 5 * 2^2 = 20
```

## Division

To divide a number by a power of 2, shift the bits to the right by the power of 2.

```rust
let x = 20;
let y = x >> 2; // 20 / 2^2 = 5
```

## Square Root

The square root of a number is the number that when multiplied by itself gives the original number, for example, the square root of 9 is 3 because 3 * 3 = 9.

The process of calculating the square root of a number is to find the number that when multiplied by itself gives the original number. This is done by starting with 1 and then multiplying it by 2 until the result is greater than the original number. The last number that was multiplied by 2 is the square root of the original number.

This process can be done by bit shifting. The number 1 is shifted to the left by the power of 2 until the result is greater than the original number. The last number that was shifted is the square root of the original number.

```rust
fn sqrt(x: u32) -> u32 {
    let mut y = 1;
    while y << 1 < x {
        y <<= 1;
    }
    y
}

fn main() {
    let num = 64;
    println!("The square root of {} is {}", num, sqrt(num));
} // The square root of 64 is 8
```

## Conclusion

Bit shifting is a very useful tool in low level programming and cryptography and it's very useful when doing performance critical math operations.

That's all for this post, I hope you enjoyed it and learned something new.
